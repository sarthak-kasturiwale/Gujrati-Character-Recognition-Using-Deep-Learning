# Gujrati-Character-Recognition-Using-Deep-Learning
- Optical character recognition or optical character reader (OCR) is the electronic or mechanical conversion of images of typed, handwritten or printed text into machine-encoded text, whether from a scanned document, a photo of a document, a scene-photo or from subtitle text superimposed on an image.
- Character Recognition is one of the importatnt task in Computer Vision in many aspects. So, in this project we are going to develop a Deep learning model to recognise the Gujrati character from an image/frame.

# Dataset Description
- The dataset has been downloaded from https://github.com/harshthaker/Akshar
- Akshar is a free, open source dataset containing 3400 images of Gujarati language characters. Each folder in the dataset contains around 100 images of a letter out of 34 characters.
- This dataset is relatively smaller in size than other datasets. It is intended for faster training of characters on any Neural Network model.
- 'Akshar' dataset is expected to be useful to test performance of various deep learning models. Gujarati alphabets are little more complex in shape than English alphabets. Thus, they are more challenging to classify using deep learning models. Dataset is free for anyone to use and improve by adding more font styles, complex letter orientations etc.

# End Results
- We have successfully trained the Gujrati Character Recognition Model using CNN.
- We got accuracy of about **97.08%** on training data while **99.68** on validation data. This shows that our model is not over fitting & predicting the exact class to which it belongs.
